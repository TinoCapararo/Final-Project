Project Outline

## Introduction

The Emotional Interaction Board is an interactive installation where users first pick an emotion card (calm, anxiety, sadness, or hope). Then, they select a scenario card, and based on their choices, the system gives them feedback and moves to reflect their feelings. The project is designed to ensure a smooth and engaging user experience, with easy navigation and clear interactions.

# Main Screen

The main screen of "The Emotional Interaction Board" introduces the interactive experience. It features a title, a navigation bar with links to different sections, and three key sections: an introduction, an explanation of how the board works, and a call to action inviting users to try it. Icons are used to make the content visually clear and engaging.
